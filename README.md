# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

Users are provided a display of historical tweets that have been made via testing.  The compose button will allow them to create a new tweet of 140 characters or less.  It will then display immediately via ajax & mongoDB.  The app will add a time stamp, a name and avatar to simulate a random user with each tweet.
